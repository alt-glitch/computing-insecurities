context switching sucks.

human brains are all solving problems.

as any form of a knowledge worker, there needs to be a fair amount of context loaded in your brain. our brain's cache is fairly limited. when they say we cannot multi-task, what they actually mean is that we can't think about two problems at once.

when a problem is truly, fully loaded in our head with no distractions our brain starts to work differently. when programming, i can see 5 bugs ahead, nuances of the codebase become clearer and more visible.
when i'm writing, various pieces of an idea start forming into coherent structures that flow from one sentence to another.

i think this takes place unconsciously as well.

there are some rare exceptions when we have a million little problems loaded in our head when undertaking a larger task, for ex, moving houses, arranging and organizing an event. but i look at these problems as tiny problemas, part of a larger problem.
