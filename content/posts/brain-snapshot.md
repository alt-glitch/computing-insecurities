(written in my google keep on june 28th as my flight was landing)

i wish I could save the snapshot of my brain state at a given time.

kinda like pausing the train of thought to come back to it

or pausing the thread

or something like how the OS saves the memory to the swap partition when hibernating

would be so fkng cool to come back and load half solved problems in my head

context switching sucks as it is,, but the serenity and "state" of the brain space is even harder to switch back to.

anyway,, internet is back on as flight has landed.

adios {this state of my brain}
