title: why & how i'm relearning maths
date: 2024-07-01

maths is at the foundation of so many things that interest me. it's also a great exercise for the mind, and my brain feels like it hasn't hit the gym in a while.

i'm also undoing the trauma or damage that school (& my ignorance) gave to me towards the subject to genuinely learn it.

it took me a while to realize that anyone who likes computing, likes math; they just don't know it yet.

i signed up for mathacademy.com for its "mathematics for machine learning" course yesterday.

got severely humbled by some topics and pleasantly surprised by others in its diagnostic test which curates the lessons for you based on your knowledge gaps.

estimated completion date is january 2025.

i'm excited.
