i moved to bangalore [recently](https://x.com/sidbing/status/1817945864704258514) and i've been staying in this city for a better part of a year. i wanted to write this guide/checklist for someone considering to the same.

this place has a lot of potential if you know how to unlock it. this guide is something a younger me would have really appreciated.

# moving to bangalore

here's a [crummy map](https://hoodmaps.com/bengaluru-neighborhood-map) of what people think different parts of bangalore are like. i disagree with some of the labels but i also think everyone has their perception, or a version of a city.

here's an opinionated view of the city. remember that, your understanding of the city probably *will vary.*

- red: you don't want to stay outside of this area in most circumstances. traffic in bangalore sucks, it's true. we're not here to whine about that, we're here to make most of the city as it stands
- yellow: this circle covers what i think to be quite dense in terms of interesting people to meet, interesting things to do. 
- green: if you can afford it, it's well worth living in this circle. travel times are low since most things happen here, density of places to work out of from, events happening is quite high in my experience

if you're house hunting, here's a few notes;
- refer to this [amazing guide by manas](https://manassaloi.com/2021/01/03/ultimate-house-hunting.html).
- it's an unpaid 2-3 week full-time job
- use a CRM if you need to, you'll be talking to a lot of people. be structured.
- avoid 1bhks, not worth it in most places cost-wise.
- be aware: bangalore faces annual water shortage, electricity cuts, has a waste management problem in many areas. keep this in mind when flat-hunting.
- prefer gated communities as they take care of many of the issues described above.
- avoid hosting parties regularly. most landlords don't like that. they're also a headache to manage and leave your house trashed and dirty, making your house a very unproductive space, obviously ymmv but i generally prefer not to call groups of people over more than 3-4 times a month.
