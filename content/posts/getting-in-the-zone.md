i have a very finite set of things i do which help me get into the flow state. 
i often forget to do these when i'm having trouble focusing so here's me writing them out so i can just read this the next time i'm scrolling X too much.

it's also an exhaustive list of things i am going to try before i take a break or call it a day.

- bring your keyboard closer and sit upright.
- get some distance between you and the monitor.
- put headphones on, play brown noise or 70s low-key rock music.
- go splash water on your face, it helps tremendously.
	- if time from last shower > 6 hours, go jump in a cold shower.
- open window, let some fresh air in
- close all tabs on browser and applications that you don't need rn. it's clutter that's cluttering the brain.
- close all social tabs and apps on pc.
- throw phone out of sight.
- text someone, anyone what you need to do and how you're struggling with it. don't have to send a message, just duck debug the problem.
	- alternatively, talk to claude about the problem you're trying to solve
	- here's an example text i wrote recently.
> tbh, haven't been able to start my engines on this :/
brain hasn't been working all day ðŸ”ª 
but here's a brain dump of what i need to do (in hopes it kick starts my engines):
...

- get out of the house, walk to the nearby cafe. nice place to get some coding done.
	- if it's been a while since last coffee, get a coffee too.
- start a pomodoro clock, work only until the timer runs out. re-evaluate after the timer runs out.
- take a body check, do you need sleep? do you need food?
