[Turn off, disable, or uninstall OneDrive - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-off-disable-or-uninstall-onedrive-f32a17ce-3336-40fe-9c38-6efb09f944b0)

I hate that it keeps getting detected as the home folder for my PC when I want things in my actual home folder.

Unlink

Uninstall via installed programs in settings

Hide

Also in the file explorer, right click in the left sidebar and select "show all folders" and delete the onedrive folder
