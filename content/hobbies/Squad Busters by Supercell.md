Favorite combinations

- trader + loot goblins or loot pi√±atas
	- Honestly trader might be a top 3 unit for me
- hog rider + chicken + shelley
	- Unfortunately hog rider is a non-negotiable... walking is so slow...

Least favorite battle mods:

- baby battle
	- too used to the powerups from unit upgrades
	- This got removed in August 2024! Thank goodness
- doppelgangers
	- variety builds a good team. seems like barbarian king might be the best in this mode?
	- although one time I had a team of dynamike and someone was trying to squad bust me, and my dynamikes threw 2 attacks and boomed all of them (clumped up, I guess)\

Quirks:

- "brain rot game"
- I keep accidentally calling it brawl stars but I actually couldn't get through the tutorial of that one. Only gets confused bc it's also made by supercell and I have plenty of friends that like that game better.
