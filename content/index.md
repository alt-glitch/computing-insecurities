Welcome to my digital allocation of space (?).

Throughout high school, bullet journaling was a huge trend (still is, maybe not as huge). I would get the standard college-ruled, 100pgs notebook from the school supplies section and wrote down literally everything in there. Journals, to-do's (a lot to-do back then), brainstorming, math scratch work, etc. We were cleaning up the boxes recently and I found them in a pile, super beat up but well-preserved. I filled up like 6 notebooks of content like this. Those things were so useful!

I spent too long changing things on the site, which is all written out in the [[Quartz customization log]], and I also have some more ideas for changing things ([[Quartz Inspos and Alternatives]]), but I still need a [[Quartz Cheatsheet|cheatsheet]] to remember what I'm doing.

I have some [[blog ideas]] too! And I've [[Infinite boredom|been up to]] various things lately.

Why does every digital garden website add a page defining what a digital garden is? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
