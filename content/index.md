hi!

i'm siddharth. i go by sidbin/g online in most places.

i'm a tinkerer at heart and trying to go up and down the layers of computer abstraction.

i'm studying core maths, cs, and ml for a few months and also building epoch 0, a discord server for ppl to learn together.

what keeps me up at night though is my quest to find my **north star**: a difficult problem that i want to spend a lot of time working on.

this is my attempt at maintaining a digital garden and my 5th attempt at creating a seamless set up for blogging for myself.

i'm using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [eilleeenz's fork](https://quartz.eilleeenz.com/) of [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

check out a [map](Map) of this garden to see what i'm working on.
