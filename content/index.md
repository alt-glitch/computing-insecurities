hi!

i'm siddharth. i'm a tinkerer at heart and trying to go up and down the layers of computer abstraction.

i'm studying core maths, cs, and ml for a few months and also building epoch 0, a discord server for ppl to learn together.

what keeps me up at night though is my quest to find my **north star**: a difficult problem that i want to spend a lot of time working on.
