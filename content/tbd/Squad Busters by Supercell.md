Favorite combinations

- trader + loot goblins or loot pi√±atas
- hog rider + chicken + shelley

Least favorite battle mods:

- baby battle
	- too used to the powerups from unit upgrades
- doppelgangers
	- variety builds a good team. seems like barbarian king might be the best in this mode?
	- although one time I had a team of dynamike and someone was trying to squad bust me, and my dynamikes threw 2 attacks and boomed all of them (clumped up, I guess)\

Quirks:

- "brain rot game"
- I keep accidentally calling it brawl stars but I actually couldn't get through the tutorial of that game
