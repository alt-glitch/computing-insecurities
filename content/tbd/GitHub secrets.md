TLDR: did NOT figure it out...

## Links I was reading

[Using secrets in GitHub Actions - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)

Need to use this to put in the ID numbers for my Giscus comment window. 

Honestly did a whole bunch of reading on this topic and I still don't get how to use it...

[Contexts - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts)

[Using environments for deployment - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)

## GPT response

To use GitHub secrets with an API key in a TypeScript project, especially if you need to access it within a `.tsx` file for a component, you'll typically set up your project to handle environment variables securely. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Store API Key in GitHub Secrets

First, store your API key as a secret in your GitHub repository:

- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Navigate to "Settings" -> "Secrets".
- Add a new secret with a name (e.g., `API_KEY`) and paste your API key as the value.

### 2. Accessing Secrets in Your TypeScript Project

To access the API key in your TypeScript project, follow these steps:

#### a. Install Required Packages

You'll need `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file during development. Install it if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

#### b. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (ensure this file is added to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing it):

```
API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

#### c. Load Environment Variables in TypeScript

In your TypeScript code (e.g., in a `.tsx` file for your component), load the environment variables from `.env` using `dotenv`:

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

// Example usage in your component
function MyComponent() {
  // Use apiKey as needed in your component logic
  console.log(`API Key: ${apiKey}`);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

#### d. Use the API Key in Your Component

You can now use the `apiKey` variable within your `.tsx` component file as needed. For example, you might pass it as a parameter to an API call or use it to configure an API client.

### 3. Running Your TypeScript Project

- **Local Development**: When running your TypeScript project locally, `dotenv` will load variables from the `.env` file automatically.

- **Production or CI/CD**: For production deployments or CI/CD pipelines, set the `API_KEY` environment variable directly in your hosting environment or CI/CD configuration. GitHub Actions can inject these secrets into your environment when running workflows.

### Security Considerations

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure that your production environment or CI/CD pipeline securely handles environment variables. Avoid exposing sensitive information like API keys in logs or source code.

- **GitHub Secrets**: Utilize GitHub secrets to securely store and manage sensitive information within your GitHub repository.

By following these steps, you can securely use GitHub secrets with an API key in your TypeScript project, specifically within a `.tsx` file for a component. This approach helps maintain security while developing and deploying your application.
