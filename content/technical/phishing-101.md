This is a blog from my cyber sec days that I have now taken down.
It was a guide on how to use the existing tools to create a phishing set up for internal use. These tools exist and anyone can use them if they are motivated enough.


But, I was getting spammed by script kiddies every month asking me to help them out.

I have taken it down because I don't want to deal with that.

If you're smart enough you can still find the blog on the internet. But, I won't be linking it here.
