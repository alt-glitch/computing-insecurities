Table below made with the help of [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [Obsidian Dataview Serializer](https://github.com/dsebastien/obsidian-dataview-serializer). The query:

```
TABLE 
file.folder as "Folder", dateformat(date-modified,"MMM d, yyyy") as "Modified" 
FROM "" AND -#draft 
SORT date-modified DESC 
WHERE file.name != this.file.name AND draft != true
```

Fun fact - if I set it up correctly, this page won't show up in Explorer, Graph, RecentNotes, TagList, or Backlinks! Also the folders view and the tags view. But it *will* show up in search, and also linked to the RecentNotes in the homepage. 

Some hidden tags: anything with "exclude" basically

 #graph-exclude #backlinks-exclude #recents-exclude #explorer-exclude
